* 12-steps to Navier-Stokes with OpenFOAM
Escalating CFD complexity, up to solving a form of the Navier-Stokes equations. This follows the work of http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/. 

It might seem strange to use OpenFOAM to "build up" to the Navier-Stokes equations since it abstracts away most of the numerical complexities. But I often find myself struggling to find the right way to do things in OpenFOAM that I know would be easy in Python or Matlab. So I thought it would be instructive to go through the 12-steps and build up these basic solvers.
