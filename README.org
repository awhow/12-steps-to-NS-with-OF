#+TITLE: 12-steps to Navier-Stokes with OpenFOAM

Escalating CFD complexity, up to solving a form of the Navier-Stokes equations. This follows the work of http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/. 

Perhaps it is strange to use OpenFOAM to "build up" to the Navier-Stokes equations since it abstracts away most of the numerical complexities. But I find myself struggling to do things in OpenFOAM that I know should be easy. I thought it would be instructive to go through these 12-steps and build up basic solvers.
